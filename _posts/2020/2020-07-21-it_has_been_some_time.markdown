It has been some time since I came back to this. After the last post, I had been spending time looking for internship opportunities for my masters thesis. I am glad to have started my journey with Seervision back in February and I have learnt much since then. I have been looking much into Object Detection, Pose Estimation, Re-identification and Multi Object Tracking. It is time for me to consolidate things and share some findings :)

At the same time, I will be brushing up on my data structures and algorithms. Recently, I have been researching into MLOps as well.

I am committing myself to one day one post for the next 50 days! :D Stay tuned!

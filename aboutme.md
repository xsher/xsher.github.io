## Hi, I am Sherly.
Although, most of the time I go by Sherly Sherly.

My interests lies in the field of Data Science and Engineering.

I am an ex-Software Engineer at Zendesk and ex-Data Scientist both at Zendesk and Go-Jek. I am pursuing a Double Masters Programme in Data Science under EIT Digital Masters Programme at Polytech Nice Sophia and KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

I have completed my first year and I am currently at KTH Royal Institute of Technology for my second year. I did an internship with Team SPARKS under the supervision of Prof. Frédéric Precioso and Melissa Sanabria in my first year where I primarly worked with video data for this research project.

If you are interested to hire an intern or a full-timer right at the start of 2020, feel free to peruse my profile at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherlysherly/](LinkedIn).

I have caught the travel bug, feel free to view my travel snippets at @_sherx on Instagram!

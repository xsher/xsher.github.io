## Hi, I am Sherly.
Although, most of the time I go by Sherly Sherly.

My interests lies in the field of Data Science and Engineering.

I am an ex-Software Engineer at Zendesk and ex-Data Scientist both at Zendesk and Go-Jek. I am completing my Double Masters Programme in Data Science under EIT Digital Masters Programme at Polytech Nice Sophia and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in 2020.

During my first year studies at Polytech Nice Sophia, I did an internship with Team SPARKS, i3s lab under the supervision of Prof. Frédéric Precioso and Melissa Sanabria. My main research is on the applications of deep learning on video data.

I am currently writing my thesis on Multi Object Tracking (MOT) while working at Seervision AG, Zurich. I am excited about this project and I look forward to sharing some learnings about it!
